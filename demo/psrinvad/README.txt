The version 1.1k was ported:

* https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/repositories/1.3/games/psrinvad/1_1k.zip
* https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/repositories/1.3/games/psrinvad.zip

Project repository: http://gitlab.com/FDOS/games/psrinvad

To play the game, rename psrinvad.com.golden to psrinvad.com, and run
psrinvad.com in a DOS emulator such as DOSBox.

To compile psrinvad.com with mininasm or NASM from sources, follow the
instructions in psrinvad11k.nasm.

Please note that the original psrinvad.zip contails scripted ports to many
assemblers (including NASM but excluding mininasm).
